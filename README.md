This repository contains code submitted to SISC in conjunction with the manuscript "On the convergence of monolithic multigrid for implicit Runge-Kutta time stepping of finite element problems".  To run the code, one needs a recent installation of Firedrake and Irksome (preferably installed by passing `--install irksome` to the Firedrake installer).
